		Golden Retrievers were first bred in the early 1800s in Scotland as hunting dogs. Although they are still used for hunting, Goldens also excel at many other activities, including search and rescue jobs and guide work. They require ample exercise—swimming in particular is a great outlet for their endless energy, and most Goldens love it! Their beautiful coats require brushing and in some climates a summer trim may be in order. Goldens are intelligent, understanding, and eager to please their families. The Golden Retriever is a generally healthy breed with an average lifespan of 10-15 years.
